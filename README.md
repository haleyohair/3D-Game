Project 5 for MSCH-C220
December 10, 2023
A simple maze shooter game



## Implementation
I have included features such as two different end game screens, one if you win, one if you lose. There is a time limit of 130 seconds. The players score is tracked and they can earn 100 points when killing the zombie. If the player falls off of the world they will die. There is orginal music playing as well as an orginal sound effect when the gun shoots. The player can sprint by pressing w and shift at the same time. The player can crouch by pressing w and control at the same time. 


## What Makes this a Game?
This is a game because there is a set goal on the main menu screen for the player to complete. The mission is to shoot and kill the Zombie and escape the maze in less than 130 seconds. The player gets 100 points for killing the zombie and gets a "You Win" end screen. If the player fails to kill the zombie, runs out of time, or falls off the edge of the world, they die and see a "You Lose" end screen. They also will end with 0 ponts.
